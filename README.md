# Challenge 21: MERN Book Search Engine
The week 21 assignment of the ESMT Coding Boot Camp required that I take take a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React frontend, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
